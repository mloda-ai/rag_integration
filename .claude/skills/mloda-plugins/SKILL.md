## Feature Group Decision Tree (Guide 09)

```
Q1: Does it load external data (file, DB, external API)?
    YES → Pattern 1: Root Feature (if data passed at runtime, also see Q18)
    NO  → Continue

Q2: How many input features?
    0 → Pattern 1: Root Feature (or DataCreator, see 01-root-features)
    1+ → Pattern 2: Derived (see Q3)

Q3: Should it be reusable via naming pattern (input__operation)?
    YES → Add Pattern 3: FeatureChainParserMixin (if 2+ inputs, use Pattern 4)
    NO  → Continue

Q4: How many output columns?
    1 → Standard
    N → Pattern 5: Multi-output (feature~0, feature~1)

Q5: Does it need fitted/trained state between runs?
    YES → Add Pattern 6: Artifact

Q6: Does it need time ordering or group-by?
    YES → Add Pattern 7: Index

Q7: Does it join data from multiple feature groups?
    YES → Add Pattern 8: Links/Joins

Q8: Framework-specific API needed?
    YES → Pattern 9: Framework-specific

Q9: Does the feature name come from configuration vs naming pattern?
    Configuration → Pattern 3 with PROPERTY_MAPPING

Q10: Does it need custom matching logic beyond class name?
    YES → See 14-feature-matching

Q11: Does it need to filter data (time ranges, categories)?
    YES → See 15-filter-concepts

Q12: Does it need input/output validation?
    YES → See 16-validators

Q13: Does it need to match against a data connection?
    YES → See 17-data-connection-matching

Q14: Does it need explicit data type declaration?
    YES → See 18-datatypes

Q15: Could multiple FeatureGroups handle the same feature name?
    YES → See 19-domain

Q16: Do you need to track changes or ensure reproducibility?
    YES → See 20-versioning

Q17: Need to understand calculate_feature() and runtime context?
    YES → See 12-calculate-feature

Q18: Does it receive data programmatically at runtime (e.g. via API call)?
    YES → See ApiInputData docs: https://mloda-ai.github.io/mloda/in_depth/api-input-data/

Q19: Need to create feature groups dynamically or simplify complex input sources?
    YES → See 21-experimental-shortcuts
```

## Compute Framework Decision Tree (Guide 10)

```
Q1: Does your framework require a connection/session object?
    YES → Q2
    NO  → Q3

Q2: Is it a data lake table format (Iceberg, Delta, Hudi)?
    YES → Category 5: Data Lake
    NO  → Category 3: Stateful Connection

Q3: Does your framework use lazy evaluation?
    YES → Category 2: Stateless Lazy
    NO  → Q4

Q4: Does your framework have external dependencies?
    YES → Category 1: Stateless Eager
    NO  → Category 4: Zero Dependency

Q5: Do you need cross-framework conversion?
    YES → See 08-framework-transformer

Q6: Does your library have built-in PyArrow conversion?
    YES → Simplifies transformer (use .to_arrow()/.from_arrow())
    NO  → Manual conversion in 08-framework-transformer

Q7: Need to understand merge/join operations?
    YES → See 06-merge-engine

Q8: Do you need multi-column index support for joins?
    YES → See 06-merge-engine (Index with tuple)

Q9: Need to understand filter operations?
    YES → See 07-filter-engine

Q10: Should connections be auto-created or user-provided?
    AUTO  → Add fallback in set_framework_connection_object()
    USER  → Require via data_connections parameter

Q11: Ready to test your implementation?
    YES → See 09-testing-guide
```

## Extender Decision Tree (Guide 11)

```
Q1: What do you want to wrap?
    Feature calculation → FEATURE_GROUP_CALCULATE_FEATURE
    Input validation   → VALIDATE_INPUT_FEATURE
    Output validation  → VALIDATE_OUTPUT_FEATURE

Q2: Need execution order control?
    YES → Set custom priority (lower runs first, default 100)

Q3: Need state with ParallelizationMode.MULTIPROCESSING?
    YES → Use class-level storage (pickle-safe)
```
